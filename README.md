# What is this?

This is the repository for a project we worked on last year. (specifically, the API portion that interfacted with the Rackspace CDN and Neo4j graph) We've since mostly shut the project down, which you can [view online here](http://www.globl.me).

We've decided to go ahead and use the repositories in a public / open source environment for a few reasons

- Having our code online is good for us (we can show what we have done in the past)
- Having our code online is bad for us (we can show what we've done in the past and potentially get criticized for it and learn from our mistakes)
- We can experiment with open source management and deployment strategies with a code base that is already done and learn new things we might not normally have been able to do.

That being said, we'll likely have several repositories online with our work on this project last year.

## Licensing

This application concept still belongs to one of our clients, GloblMe, LLC. We are open sourcing the code base strictly for the following reasons:

- To learn to methods of open source deployment strategies through peer and code review
- To share them as examples of what to do or not to do when interacting with certain technologies.

We unfortunately cannot license the code for use in a "fork this and launch your own version after making some changes." **We ask that you respect that aspect of it, and if you wish to build from this idea that you utilize your own code base from the ground up, or contact the project owners.**

Thank you!
